<strong>Abstract:</strong> Mathematical models that describe continuous thickening that may be employed for simulation, design and control are usually given as nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations that in one space dimension include strongly degenerate convection-diffusion-reaction equations with discontinuous coefficients, and in two or more dimensions, coupled flow-transport problems or first-order systems of balance equations arising from a shallow water approach. It is the purpose of these notes, subdivided into three sections, to provide a survey of published results on models of batch and continuous sedimentation of ideal and flocculated suspensions (Section 1), to outline a recent theory of sedimentation of ideal suspensions in vessels with variable cross-sectional area (in particular, cones) and its application to solving the problem of flux identification (Section 2), and to review mathematical models of polydisperse sedimentation, including a recently formulated multilayer shallow water formulation (Section 3).
